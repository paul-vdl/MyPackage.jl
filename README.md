The objective of this package is to generate image with diffusion model. In order to do this, we first train a diffusion network to add noise to an existing image and then, we will train it to remove the noise. Thus, the diffusion network will be able to generate image from a random noise image.

For now, the module has two functions : MyPackage.generate_grid and MyPackage.apply_noise.

MyPackage.generate_grid() : imports the image SyntheticImages500.mat and transforms it into a png image named grid.png that you can see in your repository and an array that could be used for the other functions. ! You need to have SyntheticImages500.mat in your current directory.

MyPackage.apply_noise(img; num_noise_steps = 500, beta_min = 0.0001, beta_max = 0.02) : take an image as an array and apply gaussian noise to it gradually. It generates a png image named "noisy_img.png" in your repository and an array that could be used for the other functions.

"""Getting Started""" With SyntheticImages500.mat in your current directory, use the function MyPackage.apply_noise(MyPackage.generate_grid()). You should be able to see grid.png, the imported image, and noisy_img.png, the image with noise.
